<p>Photographs of the Columbia University Graduate Student Teachers Strike, May 2018. In the collection of the Columbia University Library. Campbell Carolan aimed to create a coherent representation for those working interstitially in the struggle for workers rights, which in the context of immaterial labor is always a struggle for the transformation of labor itself. Implicated here is a question of “what kinds of work are recognized as productive, and therefore waged, vs work that isn’t?” By working in the context of an Ivy League labor struggle we questioned the structures of profit that such work upholds. This project debuted at Columbia University exactly fifty years after May 1968, with the awareness that there were no women at Columbia in 1968. 
</p>
<p>Campbell Carolan produced the aprons based on the experiences of women in the academic community. Under capitalism men and women are not exploited equally because capitalist society is built on inequalities of power between and within classes. This is especially prevalent in academia because of the length of time it takes to produce academic research, its impact on the body and on life decisions, and the cultural environment of the Ivy League. Aprons were made as protest signs with various slogans reading, “It’s not personal, it’s professional”, “Other Side of History”, “1977”, “Make the Positive Negative Again”, “Autonomia”, “Wage Work or Wage War”, “Make Civil War Civil Again”,  and “Autonomia” - in something of a F.U. to the high production pickett designs proffered by the United Auto Workers union, which ironically represents nearly exclusively service workers and immaterial laborers today. 
</p> 
<p>Usually in union busting it’s a struggle to get the union recognized, not the work itself recognized.  In a supposedly progressive environment— much more conservative than the art world— attention to sexual inequality and workplace oppression is both undervalued and underrepresented. These aprons were created for those within the student worker struggle who perform work that cannot be represented under the structure of a waged contract. The struggle for rights for graduate student teachers is one for basic benefits but also includes the right to report sexual harassment cases to the DoL, something that students do not presently have the right to do.</p> 
 <p>Aprons with various years  - 1956,  1977, 1999 - denote turning points in the Left. We wanted to anchor moments in the history of the Left which are often overlooked because of the monumentality of 1968. The moments in which a political effort becomes conscious of itself are usually diametrically opposed to those that are historicized. (But hey, we’re idealists) </p> 
  <p>A strike against one is a strike against all.</p>
