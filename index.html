<p>Raw documentation of Columbia University Grad Workers on Strike during Campbell Carolan action initiated by union organizers. <p><i>68 aprons in the collection of the Columbia University Library.</p></i><p><i>With thanks to the CU Dept. of Germanic Languages & Literature</i><p>The following photographs document a Campbell Carolan representation given one instance of historical struggle, the student movement. "The" student movement-- while Cynthia Nixon told us to "call her office" under attempts to inform her that there "were no women at Columbia University in 1968" ("were you aware of girls jumping fence from Barnard College" - "did you say you had an MRS Degree?") by asking her to wear an apron validating those facts, a number of (male) local representatives were more than happy to let two women and their DSL (camera) don them in monographed service workers aprons emblazoned with "MAKE THE POSITIVE NEVATIVE AGAIN". </p>
  
  <p> Here's a pull from the grant application</p>: 
  
uggle for workers rights, which in the context of immaterial labor is always a struggle for the transformation of labor itself. I...nd therefore waged, vs work that isn’t?...n the context of an Ivy League labor struggle we... questioned... the daddy issues behind all of it... Under capitalism men and women are not exploited equally because capitalist society is built on inequalities of power between and within classes... and we based this on the experiences of women in the academic community...the length of time it takes to produce academic research, its impact on the body and on life decisions, and the cultural environment of the Ivy League. Aprons were made as protest signs with various slogans reading, “It’s not personal, it’s professional”, “Other Side of History”, “1977”, “Make the Positive Negative Again”, “Autonomia”, “Wage Work or Wage War”, “Make Civil War Civil Again”,  and “Autonomia” - in something of a F.U. to the high production pickett designs proffered by the United Auto Workers union, which up until now has exclusively represented the service industry since the Toyotaization of industrial production. </p>
</p>

<p>Allusions to post-industrial production can be noted in the "staging" of the protest (back end vs front end picketting) vis a vis the amount of trash on campus and also the potato stamp Toyota logo detail on many of the aprons. We debuted a line of 68 on the campus runway from May 1 - 5 fifty years after 1968.  Students who were union got around minimum wage to march, which pissed a lot of them off, especially in the humanities dept. One interesting thing was that all departments marched together in shifts -- so a biology student might be encountering a french scholar for the first time. There was a serious amount of publicity.</p>
 
  
  <p>Aprons with various years  - 1956,  1977, 1999 - denote turning points in the Left. We wanted to anchor moments in the history of the Left which are often overlooked because of the monumentality of 1968. The moments in which a political effort becomes conscious of itself never happens at the point of its represetations. </p> 
  <p>Also, A strike against one is a strike against all.</p>
